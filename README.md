# ReproHack Stockholm Nov 6-7, 2019

ReproHacks are one-day reproducibility hackathons where participants reproduce
papers from published code and data. We will be running two ReproHack sessions
during our hackathon.

To participate in the ReproHack, please nominate one paper which we will try
to reproduce as a group (please email a suggestion to us). You can nominate your own paper and then you get
feedback about how to improve your own work.

This event is inspired by the ReproHack two of us particpated at CarpentryConnect Manchester 2019:
