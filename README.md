# ReproHack Stockholm Nov 6-7, 2019

ReproHacks are one-day reproducibility hackathons where participants reproduce
papers from published code and data. We will be running two ReproHack sessions
during our hackathon.

To participate in the ReproHack, please nominate one paper which we will try
to reproduce as a group (please email a suggestion to us). You can nominate your own paper and then you get
feedback about how to improve your own work.

This event is inspired by the ReproHack two of us particpated at CarpentryConnect Manchester 2019:

### Papers submitted by participants

This can either be your own paper or a paper published by somebody else.

Before we make the results of the ReproHack public, we would like to get an
agreement of the author(s). Until this moment we will keep the results only
among the participants.

If you nominate your own paper, please indicate whether you agree that this
paper is used also in future ReproHacks. This very much simplifies organization
of such events without removing learning outcomes.
